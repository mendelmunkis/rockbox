\subsection{Ducky}
Ducky++ is a Keystroke script interpreter for playing back keystrokes from a
ducky script text file and newer implementations using the same file format.
Ducky Script is the language of the USB Rubber Ducky.  To start playback of 
a script open a \fname{.ds} file in the \setting{File Browser}.

This version expands the standard Ducky Script syntax with conditionals,
 variables and jump staments, as well as output logging to the screen.
